# Glitch an OBJ file with one click in Blender
Download and install the add-on. Open a blend file with at least one mesh object, and click on 'Glitch OBJ'. That's it.

The add-on works by saving the scene as an .obj file and then messing with the data. It shuffles lines around, replaces random numbers with random other numbers and some other stuff. I used http://www.srcxor.org/blog/3d-glitching/ as a guide
