# Glitch an OBJ file with one click in Blender
Download the add-on from this repo or by [clicking here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zp6sd58ga81afce/add-on_glitch_obj.zip?dl=1&m=) the add-on. Install it, open a blend file with at least one mesh object, and click on 'Glitch OBJ'. That's it.

The add-on works by saving the scene as an .obj file and then corrupting the data. It shuffles lines around, replaces random numbers with random other numbers and some other stuff. When all that's done, it imports the .obj file again. Which by then looks awesome.

I used [this](http://www.srcxor.org/blog/3d-glitching/) as a guide.
